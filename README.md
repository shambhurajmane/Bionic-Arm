# Build and Control a Bionic Arm Using EMG Signals 

Brainwaves are the signals used by the human brain to communicate with the body. Most of the bionic arms designed and used in India are very costly yet they fail to provide the high Degree of Freedom. 
Due to less DOF, the movements of the arm are restricted to only a few actions like gripping. 


##  Objective of project 

-  To study the human-arm anatomy with reference to different gestures.
- To study the EMG signals related to lower arm/finger gestures.
- To acquire the EMG signals from a healthy person (one subject) and create datasets for various pre-decided gestures.
- To analyse the recorded signals and extract various features from them.
- To create a machine learning model that can identify these features.
- To apply the output of the machine learning model to the actuators in Bionic Arm to actuate the gestures.
- To design a low cost, high functionality (high Degrees of Freedom) Bionic Arm.
- To design a lightweight Bionic Arm using 3D print technology. 

We have succesfully built the Bionic Arm with 14 DOF.
