The machine learning model is built to classify the gestures such as pinch , fist and relax.
The dataset required for training and testing purpose was drawn from three myo-sensors.
These sensors are used to collect the data from three different regions of forearm.
Sets of signal readings from three sensors are assigned to 'X' variable and gesture labbel is assigned to 
'Y' variable.Then data was used for training and testing by the algorithm .The training dataset and testing dataset was in the 
the ratio of 3:1.Accuracy of different classifiers such as KN Neighbours,Decision Tree,LINEAR DISCRIMINATION ANALYSIS,
GAUSSIAN NB,LOGISTIC REGRESSION were tested against the dataset.Higher accuracy was obtained with Decision Tree.
